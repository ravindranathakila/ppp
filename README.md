# Project Prioritisation Protocol (PPP)

Code repository for running the Project Prioritisation Protocol (ppp).  R code in the **ppp** folder and testing scripts illustrating how the PPP works in the **tests** folder.  

# What is a PPP?  

The project prioritisation protocol (PPP) is an algorithm for finding an approximate solution to the problem of choosing a subset of projects for funding when you have a limited budget.  This is essentially a solution method for a modified [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).  

The problem the PPP has been most commonly applied to is that of choosing which management projects to fund from a range of threatened species management projects (given that it is not possible to fund management of all species) under a budget constraint.  

# Why is PPP needed?  

The PPP algorithm is needed because the knapsack problem is very difficult to solve for a large number of threatened species projects.
